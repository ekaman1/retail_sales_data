## Data

The dataset used in this project is a synthetic retail sales dataset. It includes information such as:
- **Date**: The date and time of the sale.

- **Product_Category**: The category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).
- **Sales_Amount**: The revenue generated from the sale.
- **Quantity_Sold**: The number of units sold.
- **Store_ID**: A unique identifier for each store.
- **Region**: The geographical region of the store.
- **Customer_ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.

The dataset is included in this repository as `cleaned_sales_data.xlsx`.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE (optional, for running scripts)
- Tableau (for visualization)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-sales-analysis.git
   cd retail-sales-analysis
Install Python Dependencies:
You may want to create a virtual environment first (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
Run the Analysis:
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script (data_analysis.py) and run the code to perform the analysis.
Analysis Steps

1. Data Preparation
The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
The Date column was converted to a datetime format.
The data was cleaned by removing duplicates and handling any missing values.
2. Data Analysis
Sales Trends: A line chart was created to analyze sales over time.
Top-Selling Products: A bar chart was generated to show the top-selling product categories.
Regional Sales: Sales performance was analyzed across different regions.
3. Visualization with Tableau
The cleaned data was imported into Tableau for creating interactive visualizations.
Dashboards were created to visualize sales trends, product performance, and regional sales.
Results and Visualizations

Key Findings
Sales Trends: Sales peaked during certain periods, indicating potential seasonal trends.
Top Products: Electronics and Clothing were among the top-selling categories.
Regional Performance: The North region showed the highest sales, suggesting a strong customer base.
